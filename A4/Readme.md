Okay so this is my final project for ITM 352. It is not perfect, but I think it is to the best of my ability. My app is to help people training for marathons, primarily in Honolulu. It allows you to track your running schedule, check the weather, and keep a journal. It also has recommended running routes in Honolulu, recommended marathon gear, and cross training ideas. I hope the app is intuitive enough and serves the intended purpose!
