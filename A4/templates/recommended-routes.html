        <li><strong>Ala Moana Park and Magic Island</strong> -Ala Moana Park features a beach and grassy areas popular with Oahu athletes, especially on evenings and weekends. Located 3 miles east of downtown and 2 miles west of Waikiki Beach, the park offers a network of sidewalks for running along the beach, through the main park, and around Magic Island. The flat, paved loop is about 3 miles long. Free parking is available within the park and near the marina, though spots can be limited due to high demand from surfers.</li>

        <li><strong>Ala Wai Canal</strong> - Enjoy a scenic waterside run just north of Waikiki Beach along the Ala Wai Canal and park, which parallels the river on Ala Wai Boulevard. This well-maintained path is popular among local runners due to light traffic and great views of paddlers in outrigger canoes. There’s also a running track nearby. For a longer route, consider linking this path with the Ala Moana Regional Park or Waikiki Beach routes.Begin at Ala Wai Park near the elementary school and run toward Date Street. Turn right and follow the path along the golf course until you reach Kapahulu Avenue. Make another right and continue along Ala Wai Boulevard, enjoying the lush greenery and water views. The path transitions from an asphalt bike trail to a cement sidewalk along Kapahulu Avenue.</li>
