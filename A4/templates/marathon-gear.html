    <h2>Recommended Marathon Gear</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SPI Belt</strong> - I personally suggest getting a SPI Belt as your first purchase when you first start to get into running. It is a great and reliable brand that does the job it is supposed to do. It is a belt that stretches and conveniently holds your phone and other belongings while you run. It is secure and adjustable for all sizes. It has never fallen off and the bouncing is hardly noticeable. This is why it has earned the top spot on the list. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SPIbelt-Pocket-Adults-Expandable-Adjustable/dp/B005OVQQBM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=353Z3J23GA2HZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CU87Q9w_DamM-yrRbpGwZJo82QAAKsVyCcReorHE-Wj-hFspE8rL0EEnKH3qvfGvgWU8Tbj0z0n5I6aOCGgdhUg4ttqDZ-vbvt30pu84_38nUFFX3g6bFp6R9L8HA7LjUycQFpOlLImWIWz8iWpS7VmD8AyGwadawLS-b5CoZLPAbckFpJDJNMvapa_diZ9RYQZ8LK3PERDGpAPdcn0B3e7cs7AF-QZtVY6eXYMnNpMLXgXU5_IvQaZY9KZ9ZzwmcdVrlW3GaHfVxmOCKmURXGSKnRaEgGTd927guuwt09Y.bcg7jg8TgtOGYeE4S8Ge4JyeH_fmvDb7UDKkjD34agc&dib_tag=se&keywords=spi%2Bbelt&qid=1734312464&sprefix=spi%2Bbel%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1">Amazon Link</a>

        <li><strong> Running Shoes</strong> - I would say that proper running shoes has got to be the most important piece of gear you will need if you are getting into running. Shoes can make or break your running experience and your marathon. I havn't tried too many running shoe brands, but if you look online you can find hundreds of review and recommendation videos. I personally can suggest Brooks and Hoka.

        <li><strong>Hydration Pack</strong> - When you think you are ready to upgrade or just think maybe a running belt isn't your style. A hydration pack could be a great option for you! It can be very useful in your long runs as it provides you with storage to store all of your snacks and belongings you may need on your long runs. It also allows you to stay hydrated on your longer runs and those super hot days. A word of advice too, when running the actual marathon it is very nice to have your own water instead of relying on the water stations as those can get very crowded and slow you down. I will link the hydration vest I used for my marathon for reference. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TrailMix-Running-Hydration-Charcoal-Cherry/dp/B07GLYGS37/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3D2N3DU3CMDK4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FPNoB53Vszt5XLSdVA4o4-I8lxrGFjnCv5dYjfxhlIP6GRoBJ-9mCp1GoQMCrrh9vnxljtaROgXdtFlLlL_VOGD5lzAZYj_x0PW83vOB-UUQ0j6ce0FHu-P57Av1Qn3RJNbNVxFJKxkGqg09Wp3cDhJ99Rirt8utTzK4vkcXanKyNTbGN8VEpWeLq8-MCMNdvOpmnePYppxXww4aKwl_VUm2gXBb4aPly7GnRF26XHhs3xg_aG8Ig8-zDrPk6NModcmFZCBe_UmMQzMDLqiDzmZ4ohYrpMMb7yiBl1yS7XGbZA8FggN5SJyiNckofOeEvs7dzEuNcmjNatRWEvLR-Tk1Vh8yvQBww2mMX4hY0OTq7Fa0hVGyJ2kDMI7nuk6eiiM-F8fzY6-r-siL5lcusM61MSZrPxNdmVC4ogR3nhOd298k9c__AGuRyXFl07OB.2lnnZfMbGENXRl-orIEzmw24ixZisbgusgA_pFGIJTA&dib_tag=se&keywords=nathan+hydration+vest&qid=1734316436&sprefix=nathan+hydration+ves%2Caps%2C218&sr=8-1">Amazon Link</a>

        <li><strong>Fuel</strong> - When you are doing your longer runs and your marathon it is important to fuel because your body is being worked so hard and drained. You should be fueling on any runs you do that are 8+ miles and especially during a marathon. It is important to try out whatever snacks you get before race day so you know how your body reacts to them and if they agree with your stomach. On a marathon course there are normally just outhouse restrooms which are not ideal, so make sure to do a trial run with your fuel before the actual race. When doing a marathon it is best practice to fuel atleast every hour. When I did my marathon I mainly fueled with Cliff Bloks Energy Chews and GU Energy Gels. I found these to be easy on the stomach and to have a variety of yummy flavors. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CLIF-BLOKS-Strawberry-Energy-Chews/dp/B00CQRWSKK/ref=sr_1_7?crid=116V9KFDF236X&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.esKNjQPgWiXDPpjBSn3comvYh5xvDHPjuXljGe65Y5YNK9scd5on4RvnKC-BY1p2keJgyrpXHYEme5iN-Wx9CpCq5nAY943ni-oUM2Yf9HX_y4Lydx7TX3OF3ZXsFwqLoyMFEFwxdKHNwYP8QjP7VDIP76EKg9JeSYKkUMC-XixAJSbv-39-PnoUzUZJuM01qvs-MLQEX8XlK-D71hJKH00k-gNTQzlC43ISBSFph4omjRGLoRRVI68a6ZAYnk6RpJa4eAEGRI6akHdoSyQ_ajNgGIjkglMR2G1Kk-w6X0ZeAsKZ9bNpWva5jVPJuuH5h0y8H6yn18IYsY_uOTbNYCjbtUKHjK2XHyIRfs7Ju7HbcvaYZJ92NyCcDqRB470aHz0yMsWYjse3nPxVmCE-nx_j4WeExsP2s2Bp-OHr5R-W0QTA0ModY-6CFVVwEZfc.MdC0FXynKAqOt08wF21vIFNxv2ZkItct5E8OYYFvJBo&dib_tag=se&keywords=clif+energy+blox&qid=1734316086&sprefix=cliff+energy+blo%2Caps%2C232&sr=8-7">Cliff Bloks Energy Chews Amazon Link</a> | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GU-Energy-Original-Nutrition-Assorted/dp/B06XCLY3HK/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2P9ONKMV5D2BL&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.aeV2-2leSPMHK-S4ZJptRimvFiKvfGS89OLzSFnY3snvQMDQtRhTZnGmoqmo4SwCGUZ7ooDx91lPThpkJnaO8NWxmJkYSgkxVTe5gTmseUFMiGSLWO_u2wkRxNr_9QtaS8ZHBY_NTBC2YJpNMGqVQPBR3jjenvOwmy1fjhPdppEWOxcNBkK4GOgkpG2ruUG7n356MZ9MEvILCf5B2f5hSw7WhRsUq_ZDnlP5Ub6KYlsgYe1qeW8wKjDKaq1Dq__Vek7hSE0DsdxNM9qVzr-Nu-BeCIrZDHt97g9T6QLZndEqFd3vXomvFX9FTexGnvHB2Z_RmK8iG9iBpa4pzXo2aRu8TwR1ueSGpeAwQ0Y6PyViSq69-cMX3wMRJhOzpST7DPBPhwolyctY18xGPf6U7_OPq_Oh9OKEjggvN0tDSEkhpoV3REOMzH8GMPc47z2g.3pzEW03A2SOYI2cjC7fy2S4HFWnXKEV929QF8-4WSp8&dib_tag=se&keywords=gu+energy+gel&qid=1734316309&sprefix=gu+energy+gel%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-6">GU Energy Gel Amazon Link</a>

        <li><strong>Socks</strong> - In my opinion it is essential that you get some proper athletic running socks if you plan on running a marathon. You want to get socks that are made from a certain material so they keep your feet dry and prevent blisters. I would say even if you are not usually prone to getting blisters you should get some running socks because you don't know what could happen during 26.2 miles! I will link the brand of socks that I used for my marathon here. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Balega-Comfort-Athletic-Running-Seamless/dp/B0015VHIF8/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1Z4M1J503D615&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fOnj7D5CIIxjS6uxZxilnerWbZUQXsAiIeY-1m8qCwuALDhtMQdpyiZAjyCporrae9K9KTFmIn-C--jrTZ_ukIH50MY4weq3nZkG_ph4tQKrt_pL_udELA-TM9vBme6zpgLiYI2ywfOvDO3gti34mfF3ijFaTjYpHY8eu-TN-TTRdDCRinBv4pr9pAHGwZ1bhSDcltuEFODvGJ13z0IHC2VyZEhvW4kRi3HI9o5DvvqVEFqveaXZKIe8noEq_BEmpHiMi5p0Tqk-W67Go1GBlXyw15EBeyOu3tFYGnv5An-2W1mR0FWVTEGhMXpb36nFqaVvSF-tvDskWG4p9sa_B5Butxl7Eub6s3m2aPQaCWZ4znBz672F9k8NTUu2EK5VZQXXH-y3_lmgsiX2Xx8AmKk-4B7UNxrYxRQY8_74g80dNQtj7pvoPxb3-dAcRqCG.xFelOehwv5Dg9zvpmgiJtIkOk0yCY6bBSz-Ngs5Y4nU&dib_tag=se&keywords=marathon+running+socks&qid=1734317758&sprefix=marathon+running+sock%2Caps%2C212&sr=8-8"> Amazon Link</a>
